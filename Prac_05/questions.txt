# Reflection

1. I try to solve problems and try to think from a computer's perspective to solve a problem.
2. Firstly I try to watch the lecture videos before the class. Most of the time I can't complete the videos but I try to. It helps me a lot to understand the lecture material in class. Secondly after coming home I usually try to watch some youtube videos regarding the lecture topic. And finally I finish the practical.
3. Around 70% I would say
4. Around 6 hours a week
5. I need to spend more time solving problems
